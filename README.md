This piece was created to satirize the pseudo-automated nature of art pieces that are created quickly, assigned arbitrary monetary value, and expounded upon with flowery language by journalists and critics. Once you've created your "masterpiece," you can use the printer generate a random line of praise (many of which are real quotes from art critics) that will display in the console. There is also a pricing machine that will generate a random exorbitant dollar amount that your creation is worth. The repeated use of randomness in the code represents the capricious way in which some works are viewed as incredible pieces worth millions, while others are worth nothing, based seemingly only the artist's reputation or what a patron is willing to pay.
